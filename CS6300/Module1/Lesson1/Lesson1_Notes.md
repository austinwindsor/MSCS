# Introduction to Software Engineering

## Importance of Software Engineering
**What is Software Engineering? Why is Software Engineering Important?**
It's the field of systematic application of methods to build software to leverage computers in a rigorous manner. This involves understanding requirements, identifying stakeholders in order to delivery a solution that meets stakeholders' needs.    

Software Engineering and Programming are separate. Programming involves actually developing the tools, but Software Engineering considers the entire life cycle of the software.    

**Why is it so difficult to develop good software?**
This is what this class is all about :)     

## History of Software Engineering
In the 1960's, people started to realize that they couldn't develop the software they needed. This is primarily due to the boom of software relevance. From 1950 - 1998, there was an exponential development in software. As systems became more complicated, the difficulty does not increase linearly as the complexity increases. This slowed the developers productivity, despite the large increase in software prevalence.     

In fact, so many codes were not even used after development that there was a [NATO software engineering conferences](http://homepages.cs.ncl.ac.uk/brian.randell/NATO/) to improve the methodology.

## Software Development
Ideally, it should go from a an idea to a successful implementation. For trivial system, this is often quite simple. however, for any level of complexity, software enginereing has systematic guidelines on how to break up the journey into cleaner, faster and more sustainable working segments.

### Software Process
**Waterfall**: go from one stage to the next in sequence    
**Evolutionary Prototyping**: go from one functional prototype to the next    
**Rational Unified Process (RUP)/Unified Software Process (USP)**: a slightly more methodical approach. Involves UML.    
**Agile**: a family of process, focuses on flexibility to accommodate for changes    
### Software Phases
* Requirements Engineering: understand requirements from the stakeholders' perspectives    
* Design: Set up the architecture according to the requirements     
* Implementation: Code the solution     
* Verification and Validation: Debug and make sure everything works correctly    
* Maintenance: Debug     

#### Tools of the Trade
Tools and automation are essential in the software engineering field. See the example belows:
---
| Phase       | Method of Automation/Tool Development |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Development | Punch cards --> IDEs                  |
| Language    | Machine code --> High-level Languages |
| Debugging   | Print lines --> Symbolic debuggers    |

Tools we will use in this class: IDEs, VCS (ex: Git), Coverage Verification tools (ttyl).
