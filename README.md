# Masters of Science in Computer Science (MSCS)

Starting in Fall 2021, I am partaking in the Master of Science in Computer Science. This repository will act as my central note taking storage place. I will write everything in MarkDown as of now and will post links to related project repos.

## Fall 2021

### CS1331 - Object Oriented Programming (Audit)
**Description:** In preparation for CS6300-Software Development Process, I am auditing the CS1331 course on EdX so learn Java beforehand. Although I've learned OOP in Python, I have not learned it in Java on which the course assignments are based.

### CS6300 - Software Development Process
**Professor:** [Alessandro Orso](orso@cc.gatech.edu)
**Description:** This is a graduate-level, hands-on course about software engineering. The goal of the course is to study and learn the way software is specified, designed, developed, verified, and maintained. Throughout the course, students will have to complete a set of individual assignments, a group project, and an individual project. By the end of the course, students will understand the role of software processes in the development of software and will have experienced several types of processes, from rigid to agile. Students will also be exposed and become familiar with a variety of modern technologies and tools and understand their connection to software processes.

### CS7280 - Network Science
**Professor:** [Constantine Dovrolis](constantine@gatech.edu)
**Description:** An overview of what is Network Science, different Network Science methods, and how to apply it to real world complex systems.
